## üìù Description

This is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It showcases my skills, projects, and provides a bit of information about me. The goal was to create a clean, visually appealing, and fast-loading single-page application to serve as a central hub for my professional presence online. The design is intended to be straightforward, allowing visitors to easily navigate through different sections like "Home" (Hero), "Skills," "About," and "Projects."

*(The "About Me" section in `About.jsx` describes Vidyasagar Akhumukhi, a front-end developer from Mumbai, now in Galway, passionate about crafting delightful web experiences and eager to join a collaborative team with a Stamp 1G visa.)*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) thanks to Tailwind CSS.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with reusable React components for different sections (Navbar, Hero, Skills, About, Projects).
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented for navigation links (`<html class="scroll-smooth">`).
* **Hero Section:** A prominent hero section to introduce myself and my core skills.
* **Skills Showcase:** A dedicated section to display technical skills with icons and descriptions.
* **About Me:** A personal introduction and background.
* **Project Gallery:** A section to showcase key projects with images, descriptions, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
* **Styled with Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and customization.
* **Data-Driven Content:** Utilizes JavaScript arrays (`data.js`) to manage content for navigation links, skills, and projects, making updates easier.
* **React Icons:** Incorporates `react-icons` for social media links and other iconography.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VidyasagarAkhumukhi/Protfolio
    cd <your-repository-directory-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser (e.g., at `http://localhost:5173`).

### Tailwind CSS Setup (as per project)

This project was set up with Vite and Tailwind CSS using the following steps:

1.  **Initialize Vite Project:**
    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
    cd my-project
    ```
2.  **Install Tailwind CSS & Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
3.  **Configure Tailwind:**
    * The `tailwind.config.js` (or `.cjs`) file was configured to include paths to source files:
        ```javascript
        /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
        export default {
          content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'],
          theme: {
            extend: {},
          },
          plugins: [],
        };
        ```
4.  **Add Tailwind Directives:**
    * The main CSS file (`src/index.css`) includes the Tailwind directives:
        ```css
        @tailwind base;
        @tailwind components;
        @tailwind utilities;
        ```

#### Projects

- explore "projects" array in data.jsx
- create Projects and ProjectsCard components
- setup return and render in App.jsx

Projects.jsx

```js
import ProjectsCard from './ProjectsCard';
import { projects } from '../data';
import SectionTitle from './SectionTitle';
const Projects = () => {
  return (
    <section className='py-20 align-element' id='projects'>
      <SectionTitle text='web creations' />
      <div className='py-16 grid lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 gap-8'>
        {projects.map((project) => {
          return <ProjectsCard key={project.id} {...project} />;
        })}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};
export default Projects;
```

ProjectsCard.jsx

```js
import { FaGithubSquare, FaLinkedin, FaTwitterSquare } from 'react-icons/fa';
import { TbWorldWww } from 'react-icons/tb';
const ProjectsCard = ({ url, img, github, title, text }) => {
  return (
    <article className='bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md block hover:shadow-xl duration-300'>
      <img
        src={img}
        alt={title}
        className='w-full object-cover rounded-t-lg h-64 '
      />
      <div className='capitalize p-8'>
        <h2 className='text-xl tracking-wide font-medium'>{title}</h2>
        <p className='mt-4 text-slate-700 leading-loose'>{text}</p>
        <div className='mt-4 flex gap-x-4'>
          <a href={url}>
            <TbWorldWww className='h-8 w-8 text-slate-500 hover:text-black duration-300' />
          </a>
          <a href={github}>
            <FaGithubSquare className='h-8 w-8 text-slate-500 hover:text-black duration-300' />
          </a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </article>
  );
};
export default ProjectsCard;
```
